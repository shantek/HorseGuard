## 🔐 Key Features

- Horses are automatically protected once tamed.
- Only the owner can ride, lead, or damage the horse.
- Owners can trust others to **ride/lead** but not **harm** their horse.
- Ownership can be transferred to another player.
- Fully compatible with **Bukkit**, **Spigot**, **Paper**, and **Purpur**.

1. Upload the HorseGuard JAR to your server’s `/plugins` folder.
2. Restart your server.
3. Existing horses will be added to the config once interacted with.
